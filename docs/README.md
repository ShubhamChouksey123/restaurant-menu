# Restaurant Digital Menu

## Objective
Make restaurant menus digital to provide a better customer experience and easier menu management.

## Problems with Physical Menus

Physical menus in restaurants face several challenges:

1. **High Cost** - Printing and maintaining physical menus is expensive
2. **Difficult to Update** - Dish prices often depend on the season and ingredient availability, making it hard to keep physical menus current
3. **Limited Availability** - Typically only 1-2 menus per table
4. **Wait Times** - Customers have to wait for available menus before ordering

## How Digital Menus Solve These Issues

Digital menus provide significant advantages:

1. **Easy Updates** - Menu can be quickly updated based on grocery availability
2. **Dynamic Pricing** - Prices can be adjusted easily based on seasonal changes
3. **Trend Adaptation** - Dish names and descriptions can be customized to match current trends
4. **Universal Access** - Every customer can scan a QR code with their smartphone to view the menu simultaneously

## Solution Implementation

### Approach
- QR codes will be placed on all restaurant tables
- Customers scan the QR code to access the digital menu on their phones
- The menu will be built as a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Assets**: Images stored in `static/images` directory
- **Reference**: Physical menu images available in the `docs/specs` directory

### Website Structure

The digital menu website will include:

1. **Restaurant Name** - Displayed prominently at the top
2. **Category Sections** - Organized sections for different dish categories:
   - Desserts
   - Main Course
   - Appetizers
   - Beverages
   - etc.

3. **Dish Information** - Each dish will display:
   - **Image** - Visual representation of the dish
   - **Name** - Dish name
   - **Price** - Current price
   - **Description** - Main ingredients or dish description
